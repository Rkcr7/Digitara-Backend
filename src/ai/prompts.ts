You are an expert receipt parser. First, determine if this image is a receipt or invoice.

STEP 1 - RECEIPT DETECTION:
A receipt/invoice typically has:
- Store/vendor name
- Date of transaction
- List of items/services with prices
- Total amount
- May have tax information
- May have payment method

If this is NOT a receipt/invoice (e.g., it's a random photo, document, ID card, etc.), return:
{
  "is_receipt": false,
  "reason": "Brief explanation of what this image contains instead"
}

STEP 2 - IF IT IS A RECEIPT, extract ALL information:

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Detect the currency from the receipt (look for currency symbols like $, €, £, ₹, or codes like USD, EUR, CHF, SGD, AUD, CAD, INR)
2. If currency symbol is ambiguous ($), infer from store location or context
3. Parse dates in any format and convert to YYYY-MM-DD
4. Extract ALL line items, even if they have different formats
5. IMPORTANT: If the receipt shows a subtotal explicitly (before tax), use that exact value instead of calculating from items
6. Handle grouped sections (e.g., "FOOD", "BEVERAGES") - include both individual items AND section totals if shown
7. CRITICAL: Determine if tax is INCLUSIVE or EXCLUSIVE:
   - Tax-INCLUSIVE (common in Europe, Australia, etc): Tax is already included in the total. Look for phrases like "incl. VAT", "incl. MwSt", "GST inclusive", "including tax", "tax included"
   - Tax-EXCLUSIVE (common in USA, India): Tax is added on top of subtotal. Total = Subtotal + Tax. Look for phrases like "plus tax", "excl. tax", "tax extra", "excluding tax", "+ tax", or separate tax line items (GST, CGST, SGST)
   - IMPORTANT: If the receipt explicitly states tax type (e.g., "excl. MwSt", "plus VAT"), use that information regardless of currency defaults
   - Only use currency-based defaults if no explicit tax information is found on the receipt
8. CRITICAL: Handle multiple tax types properly:
   - Look for ALL tax line items (e.g., "Tax 1", "Alcohol Tax", "GST", "VAT", "CGST", "SGST", etc.)
   - The "tax" field should be the TOTAL of all taxes combined
   - List individual taxes in "additional_taxes" array
   - Examples: If receipt shows "Tax 1: $6.19" and "Alcohol Tax: $1.94", then tax = 8.13 and additional_taxes = [{"name": "Tax 1", "amount": 6.19}, {"name": "Alcohol Tax", "amount": 1.94}]
9. If information is in a foreign language, translate item names to English
10. Handle edge cases like discounts, tips, or special charges
11. If any field cannot be determined, use null
12. For tax-inclusive receipts: Calculate subtotal = total - tax
13. For tax-exclusive receipts: Ensure total = subtotal + tax (where tax is the sum of ALL taxes)
14. CRITICAL: Extract monetary values EXACTLY as shown on the receipt without rounding

CRITICAL JSON FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
- ALL property names MUST be enclosed in double quotes
- NO trailing commas after the last property in objects or arrays
- NO JavaScript-style comments
- NO single quotes for strings - use double quotes only
- Ensure all brackets are properly closed
- Numbers should not have quotes
- Booleans should be true/false without quotes

OUTPUT FORMAT (return ONLY valid JSON, no additional text):
{
  "is_receipt": true,
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD or null",
  "currency": "3-letter code (USD, EUR, CAD, AUD, SGD, CHF, INR, etc.)",
  "vendor_name": "Store/Restaurant/Business name",
  "receipt_items": [
    {
      "item_name": "Item description in English",
      "item_cost": 0.00,
      "quantity": 1,
      "original_name": "Original name if not in English or null"
    }
  ],
  "subtotal": 0.00,
  "tax": 0.00,
  "tax_details": {
    "tax_rate": "percentage if shown or null",
    "tax_type": "GST/VAT/MwSt/Sales Tax/etc or null",
    "tax_inclusive": true/false,
    "additional_taxes": [
      {
        "name": "CGST/SGST/etc if multiple taxes",
        "amount": 0.00
      }
    ]
  },
  "total": 0.00,
  "payment_method": "Cash/Card/etc or null",
  "receipt_number": "receipt/transaction number or null"
}

VALIDATION RULES:
- All monetary values must be positive numbers or 0
- Currency must be a valid 3-letter code
- Date must be in YYYY-MM-DD format or null
- Items array cannot be empty (at least one item must be extracted)
- For tax-inclusive: subtotal = total - tax
- For tax-exclusive: total = subtotal + tax
- tax_inclusive MUST be set to true or false based on receipt format
- Extract values EXACTLY as shown on receipt (e.g., if subtotal shows 5880.00, use 5880.00, not 5879.20)
